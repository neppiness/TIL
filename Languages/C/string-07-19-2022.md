# **std::string**

### String class
- Strings are objects that represent sequences of characters.
- The standard string class provides support for such objects with an interface similar to that of a standard container of bytes, but adding features specifically designed to operate with strings of single-byte characters.
- The string class is an instantiation of the basic_string class template that uses char (i.e., bytes) as its character type, with its default char_traits and allocator types (see basic_string for more info on the template).
- Note that this class handles bytes independently of the encoding used: If used to handle sequences of multi-byte or variable-length characters (such as UTF-8), all members of this class (such as length or size), as well as its iterators, will still operate in terms of bytes (not actual encoded characters).

### Member types
| member type | definition |
|-------------|------------|
| value_type | char |
| traits_type | char_traits<char> |
| allocator_type | allocator<char> |
| reference | char& |
| const_reference | const char& |
| pointer | char* |
| const_pointer | const char* |
| iterator | a random access iterator to char (convertible to const_iterator) |
| const_iterator | a random access iterator to const char |
| reverse_iterator | reverse_iterator<iterator> |
| const_reverse_iterator | reverse_iterator<const_iterator> |
| difference_type | ptrdiff_t |
| size_type | size_t |

### Member functions
####
- operator `=`: String assignment (public member function )

#### Iterator
*Basics*
- begin: Return iterator to beginning (public member function)
- end: Return iterator to end (public member function)
- rbegin: Return reverse iterator to reverse beginning (public member function)
- rend: Return reverse iterator to reverse end (public member function)

*Above C++11*
- cbegin: Return const_iterator to beginning (public member function)
- cend: Return const_iterator to end (public member function)
- crbegin: Return const_reverse_iterator to reverse beginning (public member function)
- crend: Return const_reverse_iterator to reverse end (public member function)

*Element access*
- operator[]: Get character of string (public member function)
- at: Get character in string (public member function)
- back: Access last character (public member function)
- front: Access first character (public member function)

*Moifiers*
- operator+=: Append to string (public member function)
- append: Append to string (public member function)
- push_back: Append character to string (public member function)
- assign: Assign content to string (public member function)
- insert: Insert into string (public member function)
- erase: Erase characters from string (public member function)
- replace: Replace portion of string (public member function)
- swap: Swap string values (public member function)
- pop_back: Delete last character (public member function)
