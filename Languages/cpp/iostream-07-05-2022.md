# **iostream: STL**
### C++ standard input/output class
- Methods for input and output are objects
- iostream header includes a standard input/output class
- `cout` object outputs and `cin` object inputs
- `printf()` and `scanf()` are available for C++ as usable in C

### Statments should be given on the top
- `#include <iostream>`
- `using namespace std;`: to omit `std::`

### `cout` object
- `cout` object is a pre-defined output stream which prints various data types

#### Syntax
```cpp
std::cout << dataToPrint;
```

- Insertion operator (<<) inserts a data on right side into output stream
- A data inserted in output stream is printed to the output device
- Insertion operator is overloaded left shift operator

### `cin` object
- `cout` object is a pre-defined input stream which gets various data types

#### Syntax
```cpp
std::cin >> dataToGet;
```

- Extraction operator (>>) extracts a input data from input stream and save on a variable on right side of `>>`
- Input data is automatically trasferred into an indentical data type of a variable (in here, var. `dataToGet`)

### Differences from Standard IO functions
- More intuitive operators (`>>` and `<<`)
- Data types are automatically transferred: safer and easy to use
