# **Jump to Java Ch. 1**

### Characteristics of Java
1. Simple: similar to C++ but simple
2. Object-oriented: most of things in Java consists of objects except number and boolean types
3. Interpreted: Java is a compile language and also an interpreter language
4. Robust and secured: Java don't have a pointer concept and firm type definition is required so that runtime errors are much more less than other languages
5. Platform independent: since Java's extension of execution file is binary code (class) file, the system where java runtime is installed could execute the program
  * It's supported by Java Virtual Machine (JVM)
6. Multithreaded: a unit of program could utilize multiple threads simultaneously
7. Dynamic: when a module is updated, the other modules don't need to be updated
  * It's because interface defines interactions between objects, independently

#### Interpreter language and compile language
- Compile: Compile refers to the act of converting programs written in high level programming language, which is understandable and written by humans, into a low level binary language understood only by the computer

- Interpreter language: languages executed without compiling (ex. R, Python, and Ruby)
  * Don't need a time to build, but in Runtime, because the commands are executed line by line, the speed of execution is slower than that of compile language

- Compile language: languages executed after compile (ex. C, C++)
  * Build requires some times
  * In runtime, executions are much faster than that of interpreter language

### Hello world in Java
- `.java` file is a java source file that we are going to author
- To execute this file, two following steps are needed:
  1. Create `MyProgram.java`
  2. Compiler uses the java file and creates `Myprogram.class`. JVM could read this compiled class file (which is a binary file)
  3. Java VM (JVM) translate a binary code and execute a program
- It's impossible to operate compiled `exe` files on all OS, otherwise java file could
  * Once a class file is compiled, it's usable on every operating system

#### Author a `HelloWord.class`
```java
public class HelloWorld {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.printIn("Hello World");
   }
}
```
- If the class name is same as the file name, `public` should be attached before the class name
- `main` in class `HelloWorld` is a method
- `public`: it is an access modifier and means that anyone can access this method
- `static`: means that this method could be executed without generating instance
- `void`: means that this method doesn't have a return value
- `String[]`: an array of `String` data type
- `args`: variable name for `String[]` data type

### Multiplication table source code
```java
public class MT {
  public void calc(int n) {
    for (int i = 1; i < 10; i++)
      System.out.println(n * i);
  }

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    MT mt = new MT(); // let mt be a new instance of class MT
    for (int i = 2; i < 10; i++)
      mt.calc(i); // calling method calc of class MT
  }
}
```
