# **CI/CD**

### What's CI/CD?
- To automate the whole development process (from development to deployment)
- For more efficiency
- CI: Continuous Integration
- CD: Continuous Delivery (or Deployment)
- Usally both CI and CD are used

<br>

### Continuous Integration
- A method that versions are built, tested and eventually merged
- Grady Booch invented, and extreme programming method selected CI

#### Two rules
- Modified codes should be merged periodically
- Merge, build, and Test should be done by CI system

#### Advantages
- Avoid conflicts
- Problems are rapidly checked
- Code quality improved

<br>

### Continuous Delivery
- Automatically tested and built by CI
- Prepare release
- In Continuous Delivery, a version is checked manually before release
- In Continuous Deployment, automatically release a version

<br>

### Tools
- Buildkite
- Github Actions
