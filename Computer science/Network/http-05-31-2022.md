Publication date for this article: September 29th, 2018

### Difference between http v1 and v2
#### Data trasfer speed
- HTTP 1.1 "practically" only allows one outstanding request per TCP connection
- HTTP 2.0 can have multiple request at a time.

### HTTP/2 vs. HTTP/1.1: A Performance Analysis
#### Performance of data transfer
- These days, a bandwidth is enough: more bandwidth doesn't effect to the page loading time 
- A network delay governs the performance of data trasfer: it is linearly proportional to the page loading time

#### HTTP/2 at a glance
- HTTP/2 is bianry and encrypyed
- "Upgrade:" header or TLS ALPN negotitaion
- Multiplexing is done with "streams"
- Headers are compressed
- Servers can push content to clients

### Can I use HTTP/2 now?
- In browsers, HTTP/2 is supported by the most current releases of Edge, Safari, Firefox and Chrome.
- Other browsers based upon Blink will also support HTTP/2 (e.g., Opera and Yandex Browser).
