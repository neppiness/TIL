# **Object "Promise"**

> The Promise object represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value 

<br>

### Basic function
- If the promise object works correctly, it returns the intended value
- If error occurs, it raises an error

<br>

### States of Promise
- pending: initial state, neither fulfilled nor rejected
- fulfilled: meaning that the operation was completed successfully
- rejected: meaning that the operation failed

<br> <br>

## **Producer vs. Consumer**
Promise needs a "executor" consist of resolve and reject

```ts
var Promise: PromiseConstructor (executor: (resolve: (value?: any) => void, reject: (reason?: any) => void) => void) => Promise<any>
```
<br>

### 1. Producer
When a new Promise is created, the executor runs automatically
```javascript
const promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
        resolve('jhkim');
    }, 2000);
});
```
by the resolve in the executor, the promise is returned as below <br>
`Promise { 'jhkim' }`

<br>

### 2. Consumers: then, catch, finally

then: to deal with a resolved value, returns promise
```js
promise.then(value => {
    console.log(value);
})
```

<br>

catch: to deal with an error
```js
promise.catch(value => {
    console.log(value);
})
```
<br>

finally: does not depend on success or fail
```js
promise.finally(() => {
    console.log('finally');
})
```

<br>

### 3. Promise chaining
```js
const fetchNumber = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    setTimeout(() => resolve(1), 1000);
});

fetchNumber
.then(num => num * 2)
.then(num => num * 3)
.then(num => {
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
        setTimeout(() => resolve(num-1), 1000);
    });
})
```
<br>

'then' could return a value or a promise-like object
