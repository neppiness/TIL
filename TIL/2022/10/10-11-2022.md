### Problem Solving Using C++
#### Using array
- [boj.kr/11328](../../../Problem%20Solving/boj/Using%20array/11328-10-11-2022.cpp): solved (memory: 2024 kB, time: 4 ms, Code length: 414 B)
  * if there is some test cases, don't forget to initialize the using arrays

#### Solved.ac essential problems
- [boj.kr/9019](../../../Problem%20Solving/boj/solvedac/9019-10-10-2022.cpp): solved (memory: 2024 kB, time: 4 ms, Code length: 414 B)
  * Using string array to memorize the answers.
  * The counter example was 0 9999, because the current string was referred from the string in the middle of operating. 12th line is the key of this debugging
