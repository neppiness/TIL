# **SQL Query Problems**
### Problem #1. [입양 시각 구하기(1)](https://school.programmers.co.kr/learn/courses/30/lessons/59412)
#### Answer
```SQL
SELECT DATE_FORMAT(DATETIME, '%k') AS HOUR, COUNT(DATETIME) AS COUNT
FROM ANIMAL_OUTS
GROUP BY HOUR(DATETIME)
HAVING HOUR >= 9 AND HOUR < 20
ORDER BY HOUR(DATETIME)
```

#### Other answer
```SQL
SELECT HOUR(DATETIME) , count(HOUR(DATETIME))
FROM ANIMAL_OUTS
WHERE HOUR(DATETIME) >=9 and HOUR(DATETIME) < 20
group by HOUR(DATETIME)
ORDER BY HOUR(DATETIME)
```

- `HOUR()` Function: return the hour part of a datetime

### Problem #2. [입양 시각 구하기(2)](https://school.programmers.co.kr/learn/courses/30/lessons/59413)
#### I tried
```SQL
SELECT HOUR(DATETIME) AS HOUR, COUNT(HOUR(DATETIME)) AS COUNT
FROM ANIMAL_OUTS
GROUP BY HOUR HAVING HOUR >= 0 AND HOUR < 24
ORDER BY HOUR
```

#### Answer
```SQL
WITH RECURSIVE OT AS
(
    SELECT 0 AS N
    UNION
    SELECT N + 1 FROM OT WHERE N < 23
)
SELECT OT.N, COUNT(HOUR(OUTS.DATETIME))
FROM OT
LEFT JOIN ANIMAL_OUTS AS OUTS ON OT.N = HOUR(OUTS.DATETIME)
GROUP BY OT.N
```

- Use Recursive to make a table with a hour column in the range of 0 to 24


### Problem #3. [진료과별 총 예약 횟수 출력하기](https://school.programmers.co.kr/learn/courses/30/lessons/132202)
#### Answer
```SQL
SELECT MCDP_CD AS '진료과코드', COUNT(APNT_NO) AS '5월예약건수'
FROM APPOINTMENT
WHERE MONTH(APNT_YMD) = 5 AND YEAR(APNT_YMD) = 2022
GROUP BY MCDP_CD
ORDER BY COUNT(APNT_NO), MCDP_CD
```


### Problem #4. [성분으로 구분한 아이스크림 총 주문량](https://school.programmers.co.kr/learn/courses/30/lessons/133026)
#### Answer
```SQL
SELECT INGREDIENT_TYPE, SUM(TOTAL_ORDER) AS TOTAL_ORDER FROM FIRST_HALF AS FH
JOIN ICECREAM_INFO AS II ON FH.FLAVOR = II.FLAVOR
GROUP BY INGREDIENT_TYPE
```

- `JOIN` is used to join two tables as one with the key which is a primary key of a table and a foreign key of the other table
  * In this problem, FLAVOR is the key to join two tables
- Actually, `AS` might be omitted


### Problem #5. [이름이 있는 동물의 아이디](https://school.programmers.co.kr/learn/courses/30/lessons/59407)
#### Answer
```SQL
SELECT ANIMAL_ID
FROM ANIMAL_INS
WHERE NAME IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY ANIMAL_ID
```


### Problem #6. [이름이 없는 동물의 아이디](https://school.programmers.co.kr/learn/courses/30/lessons/59039)
#### Answer
```SQL
SELECT ANIMAL_ID
FROM ANIMAL_INS
WHERE NAME IS NULL
ORDER BY ANIMAL_ID
```


### Problem #7. [이름이 없는 동물의 아이디](https://school.programmers.co.kr/learn/courses/30/lessons/131528)
#### Answer
```SQL
SELECT COUNT(USER_ID) AS USERS
FROM USER_INFO
WHERE AGE IS NULL
```

#### Another answer using `SUM`
```SQL
SELECT SUM(AGE IS NULL) AS USERS
FROM USER_INFO;
```


### Problem #8. [경기도에 위치한 식품창고 목록 출력하기](https://school.programmers.co.kr/learn/courses/30/lessons/131114)
#### Answer
```SQL
SELECT WAREHOUSE_ID, WAREHOUSE_NAME, ADDRESS, IFNULL(FREEZER_YN, 'N') AS FREEZER_YN
FROM FOOD_WAREHOUSE
WHERE ADDRESS LIKE '경기도%'
ORDER BY WAREHOUSE_ID
```

- IFNULL(A, B): if A is null, B is shown


### Problem #9. [경기도에 위치한 식품창고 목록 출력하기](https://school.programmers.co.kr/learn/courses/30/lessons/131114)
#### Answer
```SQL
SELECT ANIMAL_TYPE, IFNULL(NAME, 'No name') AS NAME, SEX_UPON_INTAKE
FROM ANIMAL_INS
ORDER BY ANIMAL_ID
```


### Problem #10. [상품 별 오프라인 매출 구하기](https://school.programmers.co.kr/learn/courses/30/lessons/131533)
#### Answer
```SQL
SELECT PRODUCT_CODE, SUM(SALES_AMOUNT*PRICE) AS SALES
FROM PRODUCT AS PR
JOIN OFFLINE_SALE AS OS ON PR.PRODUCT_ID = OS.PRODUCT_ID
GROUP BY PRODUCT_CODE
ORDER BY SALES DESC, PRODUCT_CODE ASC
```


### Problem #11. [없어진 기록 찾기](https://school.programmers.co.kr/learn/courses/30/lessons/59042)
#### Answer
```SQL
SELECT AO.ANIMAL_ID, AO.NAME
FROM ANIMAL_OUTS AO
LEFT OUTER JOIN ANIMAL_INS AI ON AO.ANIMAL_ID = AI.ANIMAL_ID
-- OUTER is optional
WHERE AI.ANIMAL_ID IS NULL
ORDER BY ANIMAL_ID, NAME
```

- To select the values not on the table ANIMAL_INS
- `LEFT (OUTER) JOIN` command gives the all the values on the left table joined with the right table
  * So, to remove the intersection between the right table from the data, `WHERE AI.ANIMAL_ID IS NULL` command is used


### Problem #12. [있었는데요 없었습니다](https://school.programmers.co.kr/learn/courses/30/lessons/59043)
#### Answer
```SQL
SELECT AO.ANIMAL_ID, AO.NAME
FROM ANIMAL_OUTS AS AO
JOIN ANIMAL_INS AS AI
ON AI.ANIMAL_ID = AO.ANIMAL_ID
WHERE AO.DATETIME < AI.DATETIME
ORDER BY AI.DATETIME
```


### Problem #13. [오랜 기간 보호한 동물(1)](https://school.programmers.co.kr/learn/courses/30/lessons/59044)
#### Answer
```SQL
SELECT AI.NAME, AI.DATETIME
FROM ANIMAL_INS AS AI
LEFT JOIN ANIMAL_OUTS AS AO
ON AO.ANIMAL_ID = AI.ANIMAL_ID
WHERE AO.DATETIME IS NULL
ORDER BY AI.DATETIME
LIMIT 3
```

### Problem #14. [5월 식품들의 총매출 조회하기](https://school.programmers.co.kr/learn/courses/30/lessons/131117)
#### Answer
```SQL
SELECT FP.PRODUCT_ID, PRODUCT_NAME, SUM(PRICE*AMOUNT) AS TOTAL_SALES
FROM FOOD_PRODUCT AS FP
JOIN FOOD_ORDER AS FO
ON FP.PRODUCT_ID = FO.PRODUCT_ID
WHERE MONTH(PRODUCE_DATE) = 5 AND YEAR(PRODUCE_DATE) = 2022
GROUP BY PRODUCT_ID
ORDER BY TOTAL_SALES DESC, PRODUCT_ID
```

### Problem #15. [보호소에서 중성화한 동물](https://school.programmers.co.kr/learn/courses/30/lessons/59045)
#### Answer
```SQL
SELECT AI.ANIMAL_ID, AI.ANIMAL_TYPE, AI.NAME
FROM ANIMAL_INS AS AI
JOIN ANIMAL_OUTS AS AO
ON AO.ANIMAL_ID = AI.ANIMAL_ID
WHERE (SEX_UPON_OUTCOME LIKE 'SPAYED%'
OR SEX_UPON_OUTCOME LIKE 'NEUTERED%')
AND SEX_UPON_INTAKE LIKE 'INTACT%'
ORDER BY ANIMAL_ID
```

- `WHERE` should be wrapped by parenthesis



### Problem #16. [그룹별 조건에 맞는 식당 목록 출력하기](https://school.programmers.co.kr/learn/courses/30/lessons/131124)
#### Given answer
```SQL
SELECT A.MEMBER_NAME, B.REVIEW_TEXT, DATE_FORMAT(B.REVIEW_DATE, '%Y-%m-%d') AS REVIEW_DATE
FROM MEMBER_PROFILE A
INNER JOIN REST_REVIEW B
ON A.MEMBER_ID = B.MEMBER_ID
WHERE A.MEMBER_ID = (
    SELECT MEMBER_ID
    FROM REST_REVIEW
    GROUP BY MEMBER_ID
    ORDER BY COUNT(MEMBER_ID) DESC
    LIMIT 1
)
ORDER BY REVIEW_DATE, REVIEW_TEXT
```

- Need to use subquery: need to pratice
