# **SQL Query Problems**
### Problem #1. [과일로 만든 아이스크림 고르기](https://school.programmers.co.kr/learn/courses/30/lessons/133025)

#### Answer
```SQL
SELECT FH.FLAVOR
FROM FIRST_HALF AS FH
JOIN ICECREAM_INFO AS II ON FH.FLAVOR = II.FLAVOR
WHERE TOTAL_ORDER > 3000 AND INGREDIENT_TYPE = 'fruit_based'
```
- JOIN (another table) ON (condition)
- WHERE (condition AND/OR condition)


### SQL Joins
- A JOIN clause is used to combine rows from two or more tables, based on a related column between them

#### Different Types of SQL JOINs
- Here are the different types of the JOINs in SQL:
  - (INNER) JOIN: Returns records that have matching values in both tables
  - LEFT (OUTER) JOIN: Returns all records from the left table, and the matched records from the right table
  - RIGHT (OUTER) JOIN: Returns all records from the right table, and the matched records from the left table
  - FULL (OUTER) JOIN: Returns all records when there is a match in either left or right table
- Example code:
```SQL
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM left_table
INNER JOIN right_table
ON table1.column_name = table2.column_name;
```


### Problem #2. [12세 이하인 여자 환자 목록 출력하기](https://school.programmers.co.kr/learn/courses/30/lessons/132201)

#### Answer
```SQL
SELECT PT_NAME, PT_NO, GEND_CD, AGE, IFNULL(TLNO, 'NONE') AS TLNO
FROM PATIENT
WHERE AGE <= 12 AND GEND_CD = 'W'
ORDER BY AGE DESC, PT_NAME
```

- Use IFNULL function to set a value instead of NULL


### Problem #3. [흉부외과 또는 일반외과 의사 목록 출력하기](https://school.programmers.co.kr/learn/courses/30/lessons/132203)

#### Answer
```SQL
SELECT DR_NAME, DR_ID, MCDP_CD, DATE_FORMAT(HIRE_YMD, '%Y-%m-%d') AS HIRE_YMD
FROM DOCTOR
WHERE MCDP_CD = 'CS' OR MCDP_CD = 'GS'
ORDER BY HIRE_YMD DESC, DR_NAME;
```

### Problem #4. [3월에 태어난 여성 회원 목록 출력하기](https://school.programmers.co.kr/learn/courses/30/lessons/131120)

#### Answer
```SQL
SELECT MEMBER_ID, MEMBER_NAME, GENDER, DATE_FORMAT(DATE_OF_BIRTH, '%Y-%m-%d')
FROM MEMBER_PROFILE
WHERE GENDER = 'W' AND MONTH(DATE_OF_BIRTH) = 3 AND TLNO IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY MEMBER_ID;
```

- WHERE (something) IS NOT NULL works fine and is easy to use


### Problem #5. [강원도에 위치한 생산공장 목록 출력하기](https://school.programmers.co.kr/learn/courses/30/lessons/131112)

#### Answer
```SQL
SELECT FACTORY_ID, FACTORY_NAME, ADDRESS
FROM FOOD_FACTORY
WHERE ADDRESS LIKE '강원도%'
ORDER BY FACTORY_ID;
```

- NOT LIKE selects all data except ADDRESS with a pattern '강원도%'
- Following format after LIKE can be found in [here](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_like.asp)


### Problem #6. [서울에 위치한 식당 목록 출력하기](https://school.programmers.co.kr/learn/courses/30/lessons/131118)

FROM REST_INFO AS RI
JOIN REST_REVIEW AS RR ON RI.REST_ID = RR.REST_ID
WHERE ADDRESS LIKE '서울%'
GROUP BY REST_NAME
ORDER BY SCORE DESC, FAVORITES DESC
```


### Problem #7. [인기있는 아이스크림](https://school.programmers.co.kr/learn/courses/30/lessons/133024)

#### Answer
```SQL
SELECT FLAVOR

ORDER BY TOTAL_ORDER DESC, SHIPMENT_ID
```


### Problem #8. [재구매가 일어난 상품과 회원 리스트 구하기](https://school.programmers.co.kr/learn/courses/30/lessons/131536)

#### Answer
```SQL
SELECT USER_ID, PRODUCT_ID
FROM ONLINE_SALE
GROUP BY USER_ID, PRODUCT_ID
HAVING COUNT(PRODUCT_ID) > 1
ORDER BY USER_ID, PRODUCT_ID DESC
```

- Point: to divide data into two groups is the most important thing for this problem.
- WHERE works to filter data, otherwise HAVING works with data already filtered
  - Note in Korean: 합친 후에 그 합친 애들 중에 조건을 충족시키는 애들을 확인할 때 HAVING을 활용하는 것이라 이해됨.

#### NOTE:
[SQL AND, OR and NOT Operators](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_and_or.asp)

- The WHERE clause can be combined with AND, OR, and NOT operators.
- The AND and OR operators are used to filter records based on more than one condition:
  - The AND operator displays a record if all the conditions separated by AND are TRUE.
  - The OR operator displays a record if any of the conditions separated by OR is TRUE.
- The NOT operator displays a record if the condition(s) is NOT TRUE.

#### HAVING Syntax
```SQL
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table_name
WHERE condition
GROUP BY column_name(s)
HAVING condition
ORDER BY column_name(s);
```

#### GROUP BY
- The GROUP BY statement groups rows that have the same values into summary rows, like "find the number of customers in each country".
- The GROUP BY statement is often used with aggregate functions (COUNT(), MAX(), MIN(), SUM(), AVG()) to group the result-set by one or more columns.
