# **Hash**

### Data structure, hash
- Time complexity of O(1) for insert, erase, find and update

#### Time complexity of an array
- O(1): to find a certain element
- O(N): to delete or to insert an element in middle of an array

#### Linked list
- O(1): to delete or to insert an element in middle of an array
- O(N): to find a certain element

### Hash function (from wikipedia)
- A hash function is any function that can be used to map data of arbitrary size to fixed-size values
- The values returned by a hash function are called hash values, hash codes, digests, or simply hashes
- The values are usually used to index a fixed-size table called a hash table
- Use of a hash function to index a hash table is called hashing or scatter storage addressing

### Collision
- If we use the last four numbers of a card
  * 0000 0000 0000 5135 / 9999 9999 9999 5135
  * It could not be distinguished by hash value: it is called as collision
- To resolve a collision, two major methods are developed: Chaining and Open addressing

### Collision resolution
#### Chaining
- Chaining gives an linked list to an index (also C++ vector could work)
- Insertion added a value to an linked list
- Erase, find, and update could be done as insertion

- Ideally, inserting, erasing, finding, and updating of hash could be done in O(1)
- Collision decreases a performance of hash and it's not only for Chaining but Open Addressing

#### Open Addressing
- Like an array, some data with same indices is saved in the following addresses
- ex) Four elements with same 3333 index are placed at 3333 to 3336 in sequence

### Probing
#### Linear probing
- To linearly search a data: cache hit rate is higher
- Clustering decreases a performance of Linear probing
  * As data cluster increases the number of data to check

#### Quadratic probing
- Search a data with jump to 1, 4, 9, ..., and n^2th indices from the initial index
- Cache hit rate is not bad
- Clustering occurs less than linear probing but it has a limitation

### Double hashing
- Use one more hash function to find next position
- Cache hit rate drastically decreases
