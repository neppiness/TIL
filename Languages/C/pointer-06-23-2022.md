# **Pointer in C**

### Pointers
- Pointers (pointer variables) are used to store addresses rather than values

### Roles for `*`
- `*` is used when a pointer is declared
- `*` is also used to get the value pointed by the pointer

### What `&` is used for
- If `var` is a variable in a program, `&var` gives its address in the memory

#### Syntax
`int *p;`
- Then, `p` has been declared as a pointer to an int 

`int* p1, p2;`
- Here, we have declared a pointer p1 and a normal variable p2

#### Use examples for a pointer
```c
int *pc, c;        // pc and c are declared as a pointer to an int and an int, respectively
c = 5;             // A value 5 is assigned to c
pc = &c;           // The memory address of c is assigned to pc
printf("%d", *pc); // Print the value pointed by pc
```
