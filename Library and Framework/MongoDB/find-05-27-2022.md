# **MongoDB collection find**

### Differences between findOne and find function in MongoDB
- `findOne` returns a document
- `find` returns a cursor of documents

### cursor
> A pointer to the result set of a query. Clients can iterate through a cursor to retrieve results.

> By default, cursors not opened within a session automatically timeout after 10 minutes of inactivity.

> Cursors opened under a session close with the end or timeout of the session. See Iterate a Cursor in mongosh.


### Cursor Handling
> Executing db.collection.find() in mongosh automatically iterates the cursor to display up to the first 20 documents. Type it to continue iteration.

> To access the returned documents with a driver, use the appropriate cursor handling mechanism for the driver language.


### Read Concern
> Specifies a level of isolation for read operations. For example, you can use read concern to only read data that has propagated to a majority of nodes in a replica set.

> The `readConcern()` method has the following form:
> - `db.collection.find().readConcern(<level>)`
> - The `readConcern()` method has the following parameter:

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| level     | string | Read concern level. Possible read concern levels are: `"local"`. This is the default read concern level for read operations against the primary and secondaries. `"available"`. Available for read operations against the primary and secondaries. `"available"` behaves the same as `"local"` against the primary and non-sharded secondaries. The query returns the instance's most recent data. `"majority"`. Available for replica sets that use WiredTiger storage engine. `"linearizable"`. Available for read operations on the primary only. For more formation on the read concern levels, see Read Concern Levels. |

### ForEach 
`find` API could be used with `forEach` as shown below:
```js
export async function queryingByUsername(username) {
    let tweetsFoundByUsername = [];

    await getTweets()
    .find({username})
    .forEach(tweet => {
        tweetsFoundByUsername.push(tweet);
    })

    return tweetsFoundByUsername;
}
```
