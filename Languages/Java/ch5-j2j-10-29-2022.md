# **Jump to Java Ch. 5: Object Oriented Programming**

### Class
#### About object
- keyword `new` is used to make a new object

```java 
class Animal {
  ...
}

public class Sample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Animal cat = new Animal();
    }
}
```

- In `Animal cat = new Animal();` statement:
  * An *object* `cat` is an *instance* of `class Animal`
- More description below:

#### Concepts of Object Oriented Programming (OOP)
- The class: the blue print
- The Object: an actual thing that is built based on the 'blue print' (like the house)
- An instance: a virtual copy (but not a real copy) of the object
- A blueprint for a house design is like a class description. All the houses built from that blueprint are objects of that class. A given house is an instance

- For more details:

1. Object
- Real world objects shares 2 main characteristics, state and behavior
  * Human have state (name, age) and behavior (running, sleeping)
  * Car have state (current speed, current gear) and state (applying brake, changing gear)
- Software objects are conceptually similar to real-world objects: they too consist of state and related behavior
- An object stores its state in fields and exposes its behavior through methods

2. Class
- Class is a “template” / “blueprint” that is used to create objects
- Basically, a class will consists of field, static field, method, static method and constructor
- Field is used to hold the state of the class (eg: name of Student object)
- Method is used to represent the behavior of the class (eg: how a Student object going to stand-up)
- Constructor is used to create a new Instance of the Class

3. Instance
- An instance is a unique copy of a Class that representing an Object
- When a new instance of a class is created, the JVM will allocate a room of memory for that class instance

- Memo in Korean: 
  * 오브젝트는 설계할 개념: 차, 사람, 비행기 등 상태와 동작을 내포
  * 클래스는 오브젝트의 설계도: 어떻게 오브젝트 대로 상태를 나타내고 동작을 할 것인가 고민하고 이를 구현
  * 인스턴스는 클래스(설계도)를 통해 만들어져 오브젝트의 속성(행동, 상태확인 등)을 갖는 한 개체

### Inheritance
- `extends` keyword is used for inheritance

```java
class Animal {
    String name;

    void setName(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    void sleep() {
        System.out.println(this.name+" zzz");
    }
}

public class Sample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Dog dog = new Dog();
        dog.setName("poppy");
        System.out.println(dog.name);  // poppy 출력
    }
}
```

- Since class `Dog` inherits class `Animal`, instance `dog` could use method `setName`

#### IS-A relationship
- Because Dog is the subordinate concept of Animal, we could say that "Dog is an Animal"
- This is called as "IS-A" relationship

```java
Animal dog = new Dog();  // Dog is a Animal
```
- But the instance from superclass should not be used as a data type of subclass

```java
Dog dog = new Animal(); // Compile error
```

- Note: If the instance `dog` is declared as an `Animal` data type, the method `sleep` could not be used for the `dog` instance

#### Method overriding / Method overloading
- Method overriding: a feature that allows a subclass or child class to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already provided by one of its superclasses or parent classes
- Method overloading: a feature that allows a subclass to provide a specific implementation of a method that is not provided by one of its superclasses

#### Multiple inheritance
- It's forbidden in java
