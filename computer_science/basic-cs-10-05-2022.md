### CPU, register, and virtual/physical memories
- All operations are done by CPU: more precisely, it's done on the small part of CPU, a register
- The size of a register on 64 bit CPU is 8 byte
- RAM saves and sends CPU commands what operations to do and data to excute thoses operation
- When we excute a program, commands and data in HDD are written in memory
  * OS gives CPU the address of the commands to excute to start the program
- CPU cache reduces the number of access to RAM
- CPU uses virtual memory: physical memory is connected to virtual memory through the page table
  * So the programs could freely use the memory without considering the crushes of memory

### C optimization
- Note: recent compilers could optimize more efficiently, so the techniques described in following paragraph are just to broaden your insight

#### Avoid to use float or double data types
- Floating-point arithmetic is much slower than integer type data arithmetic
- If relatively less precision is needed, do x10 or x100 to calculate the number
- 

#### Avoid to use % operator
- % operator is slower than simple plus or minus operator

```cpp
int inc_second(int second) { return (++second) % 60; }
```

- Use `if` could increase calculation speed

```cpp
int inc_second(int second) {
  ++second;
  if (second >= 60) return 0;
  return second;
}
```

- However, `if` makes branch statements and those also could make program slower
- CPU does pipe-lining to excute program faster
  * If there is a branch statement, CPU does *branch prediction* to predict what should be calculated next
  * Missing prediction costs about 20 of CPU cycles

#### Use bit operations
- Instead of divide by 2, shift the bit to the left by 1 is much more faster
- Bit operations (OR, AND, XOR, etc) are the fastest operations for CPU
  * Using `AND` operator as `if(i & 1)` can distinguish even/odd number faster

#### End the program or the loop when the result is obtained
- Two examples are given as below:
```cpp
// Bad example
while(*pstr) {
  if (*pstr != 'a')
    does_string_has_a = 1;
  pstr++;
}
// Good example
while(*pstr) {
  if(*pstr != 'a'){
    does_string_has_a = 1;
    break;
  }
  pstr++;
}
```

#### Loop tips
- Reduce the number of operations per one cycle of a loop
- Compare with 0
- Avoid using loop
- Sequential comparison is more efficient for switch statement

#### Use inline function
```cpp
#include <stdio.h>
int max(int a, int b) {
  if (a > b) return a;
  return b;
}
__inline int imax(int a, int b) {
  if (a > b) return a;

  return b;
}
int main() {
  printf("4 와 5 중 큰 것은?", max(4, 5));
  printf("4 와 5 중 큰 것은?", imax(4, 5));
  return 0;
}
```
- inline function is not a function;
  * `max` function needs to be called and some other works, but inline function is excuted much more efficient

#### Use pointer to pass the arguments
```cpp
struct big {
  int arr[1000000];
  char str[1000000];
};
```
- The function given below does *deep copy* the structure
```cpp
void modify(struct big arg) { /* Do something */ }
```
- Otherwise, the function given below just gets the address of structure and uses it
```cpp
void modify(struct big *arg) { /* Do something */ }
```
