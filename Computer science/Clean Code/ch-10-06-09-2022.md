# **Clean Code Chapter 10: Class**

### Contents
- Class structure
- A class should be small
  * Single responsibility principle
  * Cohesion
  * Retaining cohesion makes small classes
- Class easy to modify

### I. Class structure
Variable list in class definition:
1) Static public constant
2) Private variables; and
3) Private instance variables
Usually, public variables are not used

Variable list is followed by:
1) Puiblic functions; and 
2) Private functions are placed right below each function that calls them

Abstraction layer gradually goes deeper

### II. A class should be small
- A size of a class should be measured by its responsibilities
- The name of the class describes its repsonsibility: Too many responsibilites make class name uncertain

#### 1. Single responsibility principle, SRP
- 8 or 9 small classes are better than 2 or 3 big classes

#### 2. Cohesion
- Instance variables for a class should be small
- The more variables a method uses, the higher cohesion of a class becomes

#### 3. Retaining cohesion makes small classes

### III. Class easy to modify
- Most of systems are continuously modified
- So, when new functions should be added or existing functions need to be modified, the structures with minimal modifications are desirable
