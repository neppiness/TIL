[Source code](./2146-07-22-2022.cpp)

### Using BFS
#### Input data
- Data is put in `int dat[N][N][i]`
- The third variable i represents an island

#### Bridge
- Bridge will be presented as an integer which represents the distance from an island; if `data[i][j] >= 1`, then (i,j) is visited
- The bridge must have its starting island

#### Islands
- Islands are represented as an negative integer -1, -2, -3 and so on
  * To exclude the bridge which connects same island
  * Non-zero points should be found and assigned a number for their island

#### Queue
- The points on the edge of island should be in queue

#### Return value
- If a next point is visited and has positive value, it returns the sum of two values
