# **Clean Code Chapter 4: Comments**

### Introduction
- A comment is a necessary evil
- It's impossible to maintain comments
- The truth is in codes

### Comments can not cover a bad code
- Comments are added because codes are bad

### Show your intention by code
```java
// Check whether an employee is eligible for a welfare
if ((employee.flages & HOURLY_FLAG) &&
  (employee.age > 65))
```
versus
```java
if (employee.isEligibleForFullBenefits())
```

### Good comments
- Legal inforamtion
- Informative comments
- Explain an intention
- Make meaning clear
- Caution about results
- TODO
- Comments to emphasize 
- JavaDoc in Open API

### Bad comments
- Duplicated mentions
- Able to misleading
- Comment in duty
- Historical records
- Useless
- Noise
- Do not use comment if it is expressed by functions or variables
- A comment as a banner
- Comments at closing brackets
- Acknowledgement / thanks to
- Codes written as comments
- Global information
- Too much information
- Inaccurate relationship
- Function header

### Example
```java
private static int determineIterationLimit()
{
  // All multiples in array are less than the square root of array length 
  // Thus, there is no need to delete the multiples bigger than sqrt. of array len.
  double interationLimit = Math.sqrt(crossedOut.length);
  return (int) iterationLimit;
}
```
- First comment helps to understand this function
- Second comment explains why the author set the sqrt. value as the limit for the loop
