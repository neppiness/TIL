# **Sort II**

### Purpose of this chapter
- To completely understand of basic sorting algorithms

### Counting sort
- Assume that an array is given as `arr[] = {1, 5, 4, 2, 3, 1, 4, 3};`
- We can make a table that the number occurence counts as shown below:

 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |
 |---|---|---|---|---|
 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 2 | 1 |

- After that, we can sort the array using this table
- This sorting algorithm is called as Counting sort
- It spends quite amount of memory so that we can only apply it for the array whose maximum element is under 10M
- Time complexity: if the number of numbers in the range is K, the time complexity becomes O(N+K)
- So Counting sort is very efficient when K is relatively small
