# **DOM**
The Document Object Model (DOM) is the data representation of the objects that comprise the structure and content of a document on the web

### What is the DOM?
- Is a programming interface for web documents represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content; and
- Represents the document as nodes and objects
- The document as a whole, the head, tables within the document, table headers, text within the table cells, and all other elements in a document are parts of the document object model for that document


### DOM and JavaScript
- As an object-oriented representation of the web page, the DOM can be modified with a scripting language such as JavaScript
- JavaScript uses the DOM to access the document and its elements
- The DOM was designed to be independent of any particular programming language

Python DOM example:
```py
import xml.dom.minidom as m
doc = m.parse(r"C:\Projects\Py\chap1.xml")
doc.nodeName # DOM property of document object
p_list = doc.getElementsByTagName("para")
```

### Fundamental data types
- The following link briefly describes these data types: [link](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Introduction#fundamental_data_types)

### The HTML DOM API
- The HTML DOM API is made up of the interfaces that define the functionality of each of the elements in HTML, as well as any supporting types and interfaces they rely upon

The functional areas included in the HTML DOM API include:

- Access to and control of HTML elements via the DOM
- Access to and manipulation of form data
- Interacting with the contents of 2D images and the context of an HTML `<canvas>`, for example to draw on top of them.
- Management of media connected to the HTML media elements (`<audio>` and `<video>`).
- Dragging and dropping of content on webpages
- Access to the browser navigation history
- Supporting and connective interfaces for other APIs such as Web Components, Web Storage, Web Workers, WebSocket, and Server-sent events
