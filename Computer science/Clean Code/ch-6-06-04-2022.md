# **Clean Code Chapter 6: Object and data structure**

### Contents
- Data abstration
- Data/object unbalance
- Law of Demeterd
  * Train wreck
  * Mixed structure
  * Hiding structure
- DTO (data transfer object)
  * Active record
- Conclusion

### Data abstration
Concrete Point class
```java
public class Point {
  public double x;
  public double y;
}
```
Abstract Point class
```java
public interface Point {
  double getX();
  double getY();
  void setCartesian(double x, double y);
  double getR();
  double getTheta();
  void setPolar(double r, double theta);
}
```
- Conrete Point class uses Cartesian
- Abstract Point class obviously expresses data structure
- Abstract concepts are better than opened detail data

### Data/object unbalance
- Object only shows functions and hides data
- A data structure shows data and doesn't offer functions
> It is difficult to add a new data structure in procedure programming. All functions should be revised<br> It is hard to add a new function in object oriented programming. All classes should be modified

### Law of Demeterd
- "A module should not know the inner parts of the object"
- It seems that the code below doesn't follow Law of Demetered
`final String outputDir = ctxt.getOptions().getScratchDir().getAbsoultePath();`
- This chaining is called as a train wreck and it should be separated as below:

```java
Options opts = ctxt.getOptions();
File scratchDir = opts.getScratchDir();
final String outputDir = scratchDir.getAbsolutePath();
```
- It is depend on the properties (object or data structure) of ctxt, Options and scratchDir to know the codes follow Law of Demeterd.

```java
final String outputDir = ctxt.options.scratchDir.absoultePath;
```
- In this code, ctxt is a data structure, obviously 

### DTO (data transfer object)
- Typically, DTO has only public variables and doesn't have function
- It communicates with database and raw data and transfer it to available objects

#### Active record:
- Is a special case of DTO;
- Is a transferred data from database or other sources; and
- Should be regarded as data structure

### Conclusion
- An object is flexibie to add data types
- A data structure is flexibie to add functions and actions
