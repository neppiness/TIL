# **Graph**
### What is a graph?
- A data structure (V, E) that consists of
  * A collection of vertices V
  * A collection of edges E, represented as ordered pairs of vertices (u,v)
- A graph is an useful data structure to find the shortest route for a navigation, or to set connectivities between some elements

### Graph Terminology
- Degree: The number of vertexs adjacent to a vertex is called degree
- Adjacency: A vertex is said to be adjacent to another vertex if there is an edge connecting them
- Path: A sequence of edges that allows you to go from vertex A to vertex B is called a path
- Directed Graph: A graph in which an edge (u,v) doesn't necessarily mean that there is an edge (v,u) as well. The edges in such a graph are represented by arrows to show the direction of the edge

#### Directions of edges
- Edges of a graph may have directionalities
  * Directed/Undirected graph: a graph with/without directionalities
- A vertex in directed graph also has a degree
  * Indegree: the number of edges coming into a vertex
  * Outdegree: the number of edges going out from a vertex

#### Cycle
- A cycle is a path starts at a vertex and could return to itself
- Cyclic (acyclic) graph: a graph (not) has a cycle
  * Directionalities of a graph is not related to a cycle

#### Note
- Vertices of a graph are not necessarily connected
- Two vertices could be connected through 2 or more edges
  * Even an edge going out from a vertex could directly return to itself (and this edge is called as a `loop`)
- Simple graph: a graph consists of vertices with one or no edge, and no edges are a loop
  and connected graph
- Complete graph: all pairs of two different vertices are connected by edges
- Connected graph: all pairs of two different vertices are connected through paths

### Representations for a graph data structure
#### Adjacency matrix
- Let's assume a graph is a simple graph
  * Number 1 is assigned to represent that the two vertices are connected to each other
  * Otherwise, 0 represents that the disconnection between two vertices
- For an undirected graph, because two vertices are connected to each other, the adjacency matrix becomes a symmetric matrix
- If the given graph is not a simple graph, we could represent a connected vertices as the other numbers such as 3 or 4
- If an adjacency matrix is used to represent a graph, the connectivity of two vertices could be checked in O(1) of time complexity
- If the number of vertices is V, then the space complexity for adjacency matrix is O(V^2)
- All connected vertices of a vertex could be checked in O(V) neverthless of the number of edges

#### Adjacency list
- In case that the O(V^2) of space complexity for adjacency matrix exceeds the memory limit, we can use adjacency list instead
- An adjacency list requires O(V+E) of space complexity
- Let the number of edges be E, then the size of list is:
  * 2E for undirected graph; and
  * E for directed graph, therefore, O(V+E) of space complexity
