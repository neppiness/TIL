# **readline in Node.js**

### rl.question(query[, options], callback)
Added in: v0.3.3

- `query <string>` A statement or query to write to output, prepended to the prompt
- `options <Object>`
- `signal <AbortSignal>` Optionally allows the question() to be canceled using an AbortController
- `callback <Function>` A callback function that is invoked with the user's input in response to the query

The `rl.question()` method displays the query by writing it to the output, waits for user input to be provided on input, then invokes the callback function passing the provided input as the first argument.
When called, `rl.question()` will resume the input stream if it has been paused
If the `InterfaceConstructor` was created with output set to null or undefined the query is not written
The callback function passed to rl.question() does not follow the typical pattern of accepting an Error object or null as the first argument. The callback is called with the provided answer as the only argument.
An error will be thrown if calling rl.question() after rl.close()

Example usage:
```js
rl.question('What is your favorite food? ', (answer) => {
  console.log(`Oh, so your favorite food is ${answer}`);
});
```
