# **Bitmask**
### Introduction
- Bitmask is an efficient data structure to save time and memory

### Operations
- AND 
- OR
- XOR
- NOT
- Shift

### Note
- The operation priority of bit operators is lower than that of comparison operators
  * `int c = (6 & 4 == 4); // c = 0`
- In C++, constants are regarded as a 32-bit integer: when the constant is shifted by the number more than 32, it overflows
  * Example
```cpp
bool isBitSet(unsigned long long a, int b) {
  return (a & (1 << b)) > 0;
}
```
  * Should be modified as `1ull`
- If you want to utilize all of the bits of the number, the data type should be unsinged types
- If the bits are shifted by the number more than its size, it gives an unpredictable result
