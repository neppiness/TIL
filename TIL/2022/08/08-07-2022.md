### Problem Solving Using C++
#### Simulation
- [Retry boj.kr/14500](../../../Problem%20Solving/boj/Simulation/14500-re-08-06-2022.cpp): 1hr 55min, Using BFS() with separately consider the T shape. Test cases passed but not correct
- [boj.kr/13460](../../../Problem%20Solving/boj/Simulation/13460-08-07-2022.cpp): 2hr 16min, give up
- [boj.kr/14502](../../../Problem%20Solving/boj/Simulation/14502-08-07-2022.cpp): 1hr 44min, tried to solve with using BFS, but failed: logic was not wrong
