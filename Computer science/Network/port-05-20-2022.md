# **Summarize about port**

### What is a port in computer networking?
> A port is a logical construct that identifies a specific process or a type of network service at the software level, within an operating system.

> A port is identified for each transport protocol and address combination by a 16-bit unsigned number, known as the port number.

#### A port number is always associated with:
> - an IP address of a host and;
> - the type of transport protocol (such as TCP and UDP) used for communication.

> It completes the destination or origination network address of a message.

<br>

### Purpose and usage of a port
> Specific port numbers are reserved to identify specific services so that an arriving packet can be easily forwarded to a running application.

> For this purpose, port numbers lower than 1024 identify the historically most commonly used services and are called the well-known port numbers. Higher-numbered ports are available for general use by applications and are known as ephemeral ports.

> Ports provide a multiplexing service for multiple services or multiple communication sessions at one network address. In the clientâ€“server model of application architecture, multiple simultaneous communication sessions may be initiated for the same service.

<br>

### Port forwarding
> Port forwarding is an application of network address translation (NAT) that redirects a communication request from one address and port number combination to another while the packets are traversing a network gateway, such as a router or firewall.

> Port forwarding allows external computers to connect to a specific computer or service within a private local-area network (LAN).

### Three types of the port forwarding
> - Local port forwarding
> - Remote port forwarding
> - Dynamic port forwarding

<br>

#### cf) TCP and UDP
> The most common transport protocols that use port numbers are the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and the User Datagram Protocol (UDP).
