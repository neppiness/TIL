# **Clean Code Chapter 7: Error Handling**

### Contents
- Use exception rather than error codes
- Write Try-Catch-Finally block first
- Use unchecked exception
- Give exception a meaning
- Define exception class considering caller
- Define a 'correct flow'
- Don't return null
- Don't pass null

### Use exception rather than error codes
Codes become much more clear when you use exception
- Logic and error handling codes could be separated by this method

### Write Try-Catch-Finally block first
'Catch' statement makes program consistent

### Use unchecked exception
Checked exception violates 'Open Closed Principle (OCP)'
- Changed codes in lower level make high level codes to be changed


### Give exception a meaning
Some contexts should be added to an exception: it makes easier to find a cause of an exception and its location

### Define exception class considering caller
```java
ACMEPort port = new ACMEPort(12);

try {
  port.open();
} catch (DeviceResponseException e) {
  reportPortError(e);
  logger.log("Deevice response exception", e);
} catch (ATM1212UnlockedException e) {
  reportPortError(e);
  logger.log("Unlock exception", e);
} catch (GMXError e) {
  reportPortError(e);
  logger.log("Device response exception");
} finally {
  ...
}
```

We simply handle an error following two steps:
1) Log an error; and
2) Check if it is good to keep program running

So we can easily make the codes simple as shown below:
```java
LocalPort port = new LocalPort(12);
try {
  port.open();
} catch (PortDeviceFailure e) {
  reportError(e);
  logger.log(e.getMessage(), e);
} finally {
  ...
}
```

LocalPort class is just a wrapper class that catches an excpetion thrown by ACMEPort class

```java
public class LocalPort {
  private ACMEPort innerPort;

  public LocalPoort(int portNumber) {
    innerPort = new ACMEPort(portNumber);
  }

  public void open() {
    try {
      innerPort.open()
    } catch (DeviceResponseException e) {
      throw new PortDeviceFailure(e);
    } catch (ATM1212UnlockedException e) {
      throw new PortDeviceFailure(e);
    } catch (GMXError e) {
      throw new PortDeviceFailure(e);
    }
  }
  ...
}
```

### Define a 'correct flow'
- Bad code
```java
try {
  MealExpenses expenses = expenseReportDA0.getMeals(employee.getID());
  m_total += expenses.getTotal();
} catch(MealExpensesNotFound e) {
  m_total += getMealPerDiem();
}
```
- Good code: special case pattern
```java
MealExpenses expenses = expenseReportDA0.getMeals(employee.getID());
m_total += expenses.getTotal();

public class PerDiemMealExpenses implements MealExpenses {
  public int getTotal() {
    // Return basic meal expenses per day
  }
}
```
### Don't return null / Don't pass null
It's hard to handle null properly for most of programming languages
Thus, it's reasonable to make a policy to prohibit using null as a argument
