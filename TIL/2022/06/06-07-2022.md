### Description for all-permutations.py
- This is an simple algorithm using recursive function to find all permutation for a given array
- It could be applied to find the shortest way for a business trip
- It's based on a test driven development: first, a simple array, `["Jeju", "Daegu"]` is given to be solved
- Answers and their lengths could be printed by `print(len(answers)); print(answers);` commands
