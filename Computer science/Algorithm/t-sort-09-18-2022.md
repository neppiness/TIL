# **Topological Sorting**
### Definition
- Topological sorting is a linear ordering of vertices such that for every directed edge *uv*, vertex *u* comes before *v* in the ordering
- Topological Sorting for a graph is not possible if the graph is not a DAG.

### How to implement Topological Sorting
- Find vertices whose indegree is 0
- Erase edges of that vertices and find the vertices with 0-indegree
- Repeat the procedure above

### Characterics to make implementation easy
- Time complexity is O(V+E)
