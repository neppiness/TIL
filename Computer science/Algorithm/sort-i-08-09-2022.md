# **Sort I**

### Purpose of this chapter
- To completely understand of basic sorting algorithms
- There are various sorting algorithms: about 30 types of algorithms are listed on wikipedia

### O(N^2) sorting
#### Selection sorting
- Using for loop
```cpp
int arr[10] = {3, 2, 7, 116, 62, 235, 1, 23, 55, 77};
int n = 10;
for(int i = n-1; i > 0; i--) {
  int mxidx = 0;
  for(int j = 1; j <= i; j++) {
    if(arr[mxidx] < arr[j]) mxidx = j;
  }
  swap(arr[mxidx], arr[i]);
}
```
- Using max_element in STL
```cpp
int arr[10] = {3, 2, 7, 116, 62, 235, 1, 23, 55, 77};
int n = 10;
for(int i = n-1; i > 0; i--) {
  swap(*max_element(arr, arr+i+1), arr[i]);
}
```
- max_element(arr, arr + k) returns the address of the maximum element of arr[0], arr[1], arr[2], …, arr[k-1]
- So max_element(arr, arr + i + 1) is equal to the for loop to find mxidx
- Code to find index using max_element: k = max_element(arr, arr+n) - arr
- This algorithm is called as Selection sorting, and it operates with O(N^2) of time complexiity

#### Bubble sorting
- Implementation example
```cpp
int arr[5] = {-2, 2, 4, 6, 13};
int n = 5;
for(int i = 0; i < n; i++)
  for(int j = 0; j < n-1-i; j++) if(arr[j] > arr[j+1]) swap(arr[j], arr[j+1]);
```

#### Insertion sorting
```cpp
void insertionSort(int array[], int size) {
  for (int step = 1; step < size; step++) {
    int key = array[step];
    int j = step - 1;

    while (key < array[j] && j >= 0) {
      array[j + 1] = array[j];
      --j;
    }
    array[j + 1] = key;
  }
}
```

### Merge sort
- Merging logic
```cpp
    int aidx = 0, bidx = 0;
    while(aidx != N && bidx != M) {
        if(a[aidx] >= b[bidx]) cout << b[bidx++] << ' ';
        else cout << a[aidx++] << ' ';
    }
    for(int i = aidx; i < N; i++) cout << a[i] << ' ';
    for(int i = bidx; i < M; i++) cout << b[i] << ' ';
```

- Merge sort has a time complexity of O(NlgN)

#### Stable sort
- Elements have same level of priority could be mixed after sorting completed
- Stable sort always gives same order between the elements in same level of priority

> Stable sorting algorithms preserve the relative order of equal elements, while unstable sorting algorithms don’t. In other words, stable sorting maintains the position of two equals elements relative to one another. [from Stable Sorting Algorithms](https://www.baeldung.com/cs/stable-sorting-algorithms#:~:text=Stable%20sorting%20algorithms%20preserve%20the,elements%20relative%20to%20one%20another.)

- Basically, merge sort is a stable sort

### Quick sort
- Additional space is not required for quick sort: this characteristic is *In-Place Sort*
- Main logic is shown like below:
```cpp
int arr[8] = {6, -8, 1, 12, 8, 3, 7, -7};
int pivot = arr[0];
int l = 1, r = 7;
while(1) {
  while(l <= r && arr[l] <= pivot) l++;
  while(l <= r && arr[r] > pivot) r--;
  if(l > r) break;
  swap(arr[l], arr[r]);
}
swap(arr[0], arr[r]);
```
- Quick sort is not a stable sort

#### Time complexity of Quick sort
- Normally, quick sort has O(NlgN) of time complexity, and its high cache hit-rate makes it fast
- The worst case scenario for Quick sort has a O(N^2) of time complexity
  * This is why we shouldn't use quick sort for a problem solving without STL

#### Introspective sort
- It is true that most of libraries use quick sort, their sorting logics are based on quick sort
- To guarantee O(NlgN) of time complexity, some processes like heap sort which is applied when the depth of recursion is reached some amount, or multiple pivot values are set
- A sorting algorithm with these features is called as an Introspecitve sort
