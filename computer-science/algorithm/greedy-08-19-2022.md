# **Greedy**

### Introduction
- Greedy algorithm chooses the answer looks like optimum one
- Narrow the range of the answer from observation
- Merge algorithm in Merge sort is a good example for greedy algorithm

### Solving procedure
- Consider a method to narrow the observation range
- Mathematically proove that the method could derive an answer
- Implement it
  * It's hard to do a strict proof in coding test, so you should trust and implement it

### Strategy for coding tests
- Case i: You feel sure for your greedy solution:
  * Implement it and check
  * If it is wrong, just give up and go to the next problem
- Case ii: You have a solution but you don't have enough confidence
  * Start to implement 20 ~ 40 min. before the test ends
