# **f-string in python**

### Why should we use f-string
#### Disadvantages of %-formatting and str.format() method
- In older version of Python, %-formatting and str.format() method are mainly applied to deal with string type

```python
# An example of %-formatting

name = 'song'
sex = 'male'
married = 'married'
language = 'python'
job = 's/w engineer'

'Hi, I am %s. I am %s and I like to use %s. I am %s and I was %s. Nice to meet you.' % (name, job, language, sex, married)
>>> 'Hi, I am song. I am s/w engineer and I like to use python. I am male and I was married. Nice to meet you.'
```
```python
# An example of 'str.format()' method

'Hi, I am {}, I am {} and I like to use {}. I am {} and I was {}. Nice to meet you.'.format(name, job, language, sex, married)
>>> 'Hi, I am song, I am s/w engineer and I like to use python. I am male and I was married. Nice to meet you.'
```

- As shown in two examples, the readability for two methods is not good
- To improve the readability of the string expressions, Python 3.6 or newer version introduced a new string formatting mechanism: Literal String Interpolation
- In PEP 498, such strings will be referred to as “f-strings” standing for “formatted strings”.

#### About f-string
f-string:
- is a literal string, prefixed with ‘f’, which contains expressions inside braces;
- provides a way to embed expressions inside string literals, using a minimal syntax;
- is an expression evaluated at run time, not a constant value and;
- The expressions are replaced with their values

**An example of f-string**
```py
>>> import datetime
>>> name = 'Fred'
>>> age = 50
>>> anniversary = datetime.date(1991, 10, 12)
>>> f'My name is {name}, my age next year is {age+1}, my anniversary is {anniversary:%A, %B %d, %Y}.'
'My name is Fred, my age next year is 51, my anniversary is Saturday, October 12, 1991.'
>>> f'He said his name is {name!r}.'
"He said his name is 'Fred'."
```
