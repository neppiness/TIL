- Conclusion

### Three principles for TDD
1) Don't write actual code before a unit test fails
2) Write a unit test that passes compile and makes runtime error
3) Write an actual code to pass that unit test

### Maintain clean test code
- Test codes are important as actual codes

#### Test gives flexibility, maintainability, and reusability
- If test codes are not clean, we lose it eventually

### Clean test code
- Reability is an essential for a clean test code
- pp. 158-160 give an example for a clean test code

### One assert per test
- It's not essential to use one assert for one test, but assert statements should be reduced if it is possible

#### One concept per test
- A test function should test one concept

### F.I.R.S.T.
- Fast: test should be fast
- Independent: tests should be independent to each other
- Repeatable: tests should be repeatable in any condition
- Self-validating: test should return a boolean value
- Timely: test should be written timely
