```js
let keyboard =
    [["a","b","c","d","e","f"],
    ["g","h","i","j","k","l"],
    ["m","n","o","p","q","r"],
    ["s","t","u","v","w","x"],
    ["y","z","a","b","c","d"],
    ["j","i","h","g","f","e"]];
```

### Problem
- Find a letter of a given word on the borad
- Calculate the distance from a letter to the next one
- Return the total distances and the number of counted distances

### Distance calculation
- A distance between a letter to the other should be calculated by the summation of horizontal and vertical distances
- A distance is calculated only if both letters are on the board
- If there isn't a letter on the board, the value for a distance should be 20, and this distance should be counted

### Rule to find a letter with close distance
- If there are same letters, the one close to current letter is selected as a next one

### Limits
- The length of input (string) should be greater than 1 and not greater than 40: `2 <= word.length <= 40`
