# **Depth First Search**

### Similariry between BFS and DFS
- Basically DFS is similar to BFS
- The only difference is that DFS uses stack rather than queue

### Steps for DFS
1. Put the coordinates of an initial vertice in a *stack*, and mark the initial vertice as a visited vertice
2. Pop the element (or elements) from *stack* and do step 3 for vertices on top, bottom, left and right
3. An element that the program visit for the first time, the element is checked and put to queue; visited elements are just skipped
4. Repeat steps above until the *stack* becomes empty

### Use of DFS
- Searching data structures such as a tree and a graph
