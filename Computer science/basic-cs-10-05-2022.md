### CPU, register, and virtual/physical memories
- All operations are done by CPU: more precisely, it's done on the small part of CPU, a register
- The size of a register on 64 bit CPU is 8 byte
- RAM saves and sends CPU commands what operations to do and data to excute thoses operation
- When we excute a program, commands and data in HDD are written in memory
  * OS gives CPU the address of the commands to excute to start the program
- CPU cache reduces the number of access to RAM
- CPU uses virtual memory: physical memory is connected to virtual memory through the page table
  * So the programs could freely use the memory without considering the crushes of memory
