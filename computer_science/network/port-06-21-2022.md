# **Review Port in Network**

### TL;DR
- A port is a virtual point where network connections start and end
- OS manages it
- Each port is associated with a specific process or service
- Some port numbers are already used for their specific purposes
- Firewalls block the ports to defend the user from attackers

### What is a port?
- A port is a virtual point where network connections start and end
- Ports are software-based and managed by a computer's operating system
- Each port is associated with a specific process or service
- Ports allow computers to easily differentiate between different kinds of traffic:
  * ex) Emails go to a different port than webpages, even though both reach a computer over the same Internet connection

<br>

### What is a port number?
- Ports are standardized across all network-connected devices, with each port assigned a number
- Most ports are reserved for certain protocols:
  * For example, all Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) messages go to port 80
- While IP addresses enable messages to go to and from specific devices, port numbers allow targeting of specific services or applications within those devices

### How do ports make network connections more efficient?
- The use of ports helps computers understand what to do with the data they receive
- Because vastly different types of data flow to and from a computer over the same network connection

### Are ports part of the network layer?
- The OSI model is a conceptual model of how the Internet works. It divides different Internet services and processes into 7 layers. These layers are:

![osi-model-7-layers](./img/osi-model-7-layers.svg)

- Ports are a transport layer (layer 4) concept
- Only TCP or UDP can indicate which port a packet should go to
- TCP and UDP headers have a section for indicating port numbers
- Meanwhile, IP (the Internet Protocol included in layer 3) are unaware of what port is in use in a given network connection
- Usually, the inability to indicate the port at the network layer has no impact on networking processes
- Because network layer protocols are almost always used in conjunction with a transport layer protocol

#### About UDP that can sepcify a particular port
- However, that inability does impact the functionality of testing software, which is software that "pings" IP addresses using Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) packets
- ICMP is a network layer protocol that can ping networked devices â€” but without the ability to ping specific ports, network administrators cannot test specific services within those devices
- Some ping software, such as My Traceroute, offers the option to send UDP packets
- UDP is a transport layer protocol that can specify a particular port, as opposed to ICMP, which cannot specify a port
- By adding a UDP header to ICMP packets, network administrators can test specific ports within a networked device

<br>

### Why do firewalls sometimes block specific ports?
- A firewall is a security system that blocks or allows network traffic based on a set of security rules
- It's used because some attackers can try to send malicious traffic to random ports
- Properly configured firewalls block traffic to all ports by default except for a few predetermined ports known to be in common use

<br>

### What are the different port numbers?
- There are 65,535 possible port numbers, but not all are in common use
- Some of the most commonly used ports are listed as below:
  * Ports 20 and 21: File Transfer Protocol (FTP) for transferring files
  * Port 22: Secure Shell (SSH); one of the tunneling protocols that create secure network connections
  * Port 25: Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) for email.
  * Port 53: Domain Name System (DNS)
  * Port 80: Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)
  * Port 123: Network Time Protocol (NTP)
  * Port 179: Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)
  * Port 443: HTTP Secure (HTTPS)
  * Port 500: Internet Security Association and Key Management Protocol (ISAKMP)
  * Port 3389: Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)
