# **Pointer #1**

### Review: pointer
#### Basics
- Pointer has an address in its 4-byte capacity
- Pointer has a type and can be declared as:

```cpp
int* a;
int *b;
```

- However, the following statements raises errors

```cpp
int* a, b;
int c = 213;
b = &c;
```
```shell
error: invalid conversion from 'int*' to 'int' [-fpermissive]
```

- Because b is not declared as pointer variable with `int* a, b;` statement
  * Thus, to be clear, `int *a, *b` should be used in my opinion

#### Unary operator & and *
- *Unary* operator `&` returns an address of a variable
```cpp
int *a;
int c = 213;
a = &c; // address of int type variable 'c' is assigned to pointer variable 'a'
```
- *Unary* operator `*` returns the value pointed by the pointer variable

#### Why pointers have types?
- Pointer only has a starting address to get a data
- Without type of pointer, Computer never knows how many bytes to read


#### Pointer constant
- It's okay to use a pointer constant as below:
```cpp
int b = 213;
int* const a = &b;
cout << *a << '\n';

b = 123;
cout << *a << '\n';
```
- Because the pointing target of `a` is not changed
- `const` fixes the thing follows after `const` keyword, so `a` could not be changed

```cpp
int a = 3;
const int* pa = &a;
*pa = 5;
```
- In here, `a` cannot be changed through `pa`
- However, `a` can be changed by a command like `a = 5;`
- To fix both address and value, `const` could be used as below:

```cpp
const int* const pa = &a;
```

#### Pointer operate
```cpp
int a, b;
int *pa = &a, *pb = &b;
cout << pa + pb << '\n';
```

- It raises error as:
```shell
error: invalid operands of types 'int*' and 'int*' to binary 'operator+'
```

- However, any integer `n` could be summed or subtracted to an address
- Also, addresses could be subtracted to each other
- If an integer `n` is summed, the address is increased by `n * (size of data type)`
