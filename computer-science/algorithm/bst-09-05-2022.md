# **Binary search tree**

### What's tree?
- A tree is non-linear and a hierarchical data structure consisting of a collection of nodes such that each node of the tree stores a value and a list of references to other nodes (the “children”)

### Concepts
- Vertex (or node): Each element on tree
- Root: the node on the top of a tree
- Leaf: the node on the the lowest level of a tree
- Edge: the line connects between nodes
- Parent and child node: for the connected nodes, a node on an upper level is called as a parent node and the other node on a lower level is called as a child node
- For a node with the nodes and edges under that is called as subtree
- A height of a tree is defined as the maximum level of a leaf
- A tree contains nodes with only 2 or less child nodes is called as a binary tree

### Binary search tree
Binary Search Tree is a node-based binary tree data structure which has the following properties:
- The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys lesser than the node’s key
- The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node’s key
- The left and riaght subtree each must also be a binary search tree

#### Benifits using binary search tree
- insert, erase, find, and update functions could be done in O(lgN) of time complexity
- If erase, find and update are frequently used, binary search tree should be applied
- Sorting is the advantage of binary search tree over hash:
  * Hash cannot be used to compare between elements
- However, if the tree is not evenly distributed, the time complexity of its functions are larger then O(lgN)
  * Indeed, the worst time complexity of a binary search tree is O(N) as for an linked list

### Self-balancing tree
- It's introduced to prevent this unequal distribution
- AVL tree and Red Black Tree are the typical self-balancing trees
- If the unequality occurs, break down the tree and make it evenly distributed
- It's not easy to implement so we use STL when we need tree data structure

### STL: set, multiset, map
- Unlike hash, an iterator for set could be moved by ++ or -- operators
- Like binary search, lower_bound and upper_bound exist
- insert, erase, find, lower_bound, next, and prev functions have time complexity of O(lgN)
- advance function also has a time complexity of O(lgN) so be careful to use it
