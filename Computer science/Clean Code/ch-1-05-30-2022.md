### Let there be code
- Codes are the language of specification
- Precise expression is needed sometime

### Bad codes
- A company fails by bad codes

### Price of bad code
- Bad codes decrease the speed of development
- Attitude: bad codes are totally made by developers
- Paradox: programmers write bad codes to meet due date, but written bad codes make programmers not to meet due date
- Art named clean code: 'code sense' is required
  * A function works one function
  * Proper error processing is necessary
  * Coded with caution
  * Do what is assumed to do

### We are authors

- We spend much more time reading code than writing code (about 10:1)

### Boy scouts
- The boy scouts have a rule: “Always leave the campground cleaner than you found it.”

### Conclusion
