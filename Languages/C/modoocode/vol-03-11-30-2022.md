# **stdin and buffer**

### Understanding of stdin buffer
```cpp
printf("숫자를 입력하세요 : ");
scanf("%d", &num);

printf("문자를 입력하세요 : ");
scanf("%c", &c);
```
```log
숫자를 입력하세요 : 1
문자를 입력하세요 : 
```
- stdin (standard input, scanf) uses a buffer
- Buffer saves keyboard inputs, however, `\n` is also saved in buffer
- stdin gets data until ' ', '\n' and '\t' is appeared
  * These characters are inputted by space, enter, and tab key, respectively
- `scanf("%c", &c);` gets only one character, '\n' from buffer, so it's not work correctly as the log above
- We should be careful to use %c when we use stdin for input

### Solving scanf problem
- getchar() function could catch the remaining character

### Clear buffer using C++
- Using `cin.ignore()` can clear a remaining character like '\n'
```cpp
string a, b;
cin >> a;
cin.ignore();
getline(cin, b);
cout << a << '\n' << b;
```
