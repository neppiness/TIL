# **Dynamic Programming**

### Introduction
- Algorithm to solve complicated problem from solutions of relatively simple problems
  * Find a recurrence relation and solve problems in sequence

### Fibonacci sequence
- Without DP, to calculate the ith element of Fibonacci sequnce requires O(1.618^N)
- However, we can memorize the sequence and reduce the number of calculation

|0|1|2|3|4|5|6 |7 |
|-|-|-|-|-|-|--|--|
|1|1|2|3|5|8|13|21|

- To solve DP problems, we should determine recurrence relations to construct a table
- Once a table is constructed, the variables are just calculated according to the table
