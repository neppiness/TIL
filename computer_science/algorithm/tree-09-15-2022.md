# **Tree**
### Definition
- A tree is non-linear and a hierarchical data structure
  * Consisting of a collection of nodes: each node stores a value and a list of references to other nodes (the “children”)
- A special case of a graph

#### Terminology
- Parent Node: The node which is a predecessor of a node is called the parent node of that node
- Child Node: The node which is the immediate successor of a node is called the child node of that node
- Root Node: The topmost node of a tree or the node which does not have any parent node is called the root node
  * A non-empty tree must contain only one root node and exactly one path from the root to all other nodes of the tree

- Level of a node: The count of edges on the path from the root node to that node. The root node has level 0
- Subtree: Any node of the tree along with its descendant

- Leaf Node or External Node: The nodes which do not have any child nodes are called leaf nodes
- Internal node: A node with at least one child is called Internal Node
  * Which is not a leaf node
- Ancestor of a Node: Any predecessor nodes on the path of the root to that node are called Ancestors of that node
- Descendant: Any successor node on the path from the leaf node to that node
- Sibling: Children of the same parent node are called siblings
- Neighbour of a Node: Parent or child nodes of that node are called neighbors of that node

#### Mathematical definition
- Undirected acyclic connected graph
  * A connected graph that losts connectivity if an edge of a graph is deleted
  * A graph with unique simple paths that connects two nodes
  * A connected graph that has *V* vertices and *V-1* edges

### Using BFS and DFS on tree
- Declare array `p` to store an ID of parent nodes
- Example code for BFS
```cpp
// If 10 nodes are given for problems
vector<int> adj[10];
int p[10];
int depth[10]; // to calculate depth of nodes
void bfs(int root) {
  queue<int> q;
  q.push(root);
  while(!q.empty()) {
    int cur = q.front();
    q.pop();
    cout << cur << ' ';
    for(int nxt : adj[cur]) {
      if(p[cur] == nxt) continue;
      q.push(nxt);
      p[nxt] = cur;
      depth[nxt] = depth[cur] + 1;
    }
  }
}
```
- Time complexity: O(V+E) = O(V+V-1) = O(V)

- Example code for DFS
  * Use stack instead of queue
```cpp
vector<int> adj[10];
int p[10];
int depth[10]; // to calculate depth of nodes
void dfs(int root) {
  stack<int> s;
  s.push(root);
  while(!s.empty()) {
    int cur = s.front();
    s.pop();
    cout << cur << ' ';
    for(int nxt : adj[cur]) {
      if(p[cur] == nxt) continue;
      s.push(nxt);
      p[nxt] = cur;
      depth[nxt] = depth[cur] + 1;
    }
  }
}
```
- Fill parent nodes and depths
```cpp
vector<int> adj[10];
int p[10];
int depth[10];
void dfs(int cur) {
  cout << cur << ' ';
  for(int nxt : adj[cur]) {
    if(p[cur] == nxt) continue;
    p[nxt] = cur;
    depth[nxt] = depth[cur] + 1;
    dfs(nxt);
  }
}
```
- Simple traverse code with recursion
```cpp
// cur for child nodes
// par for parent node
vector<int> adj[10];
void dfs(int cur, int par) {
  cout << cur << ' ';
  for(int nxt : adj[cur]) {
    if(p[cur] == nxt) continue;
    dfs(nxt, cur);
  }
}
// call dfs(1, 0);
```
- Be careful with stack overflow

### Binary tree search
- A binary tree has Level, inorder, preorder and postorder traversals

#### Level traversal
```cpp
int lc[9] = {0, 2, 4, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0};
int rc[9] = {0, 3, 5, 7, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0};
void bfs() {
  queue<int> q;
  q.push(1); // root = 1
  while(!q.empty()) {
    int cur = q.front();
    q.pop();
    cout << cur << ' ';
    if(lc[cur]) q.push(lc[cur]);
    if(rc[cur]) q.push(rc[cur]);
  }
}
```

#### Preorder traversal
- The procedure of preorder traversal
  * Visit current node
  * Preorder Traverse left subtree
  * Preorder Traverse right subtree
- Work as same as DFS
- Implementation
```cpp
int lc[9] = {0, 2, 4, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0};
int rc[9] = {0, 3, 5, 7, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0};
void preorder(int cur) {
  cout << cur << ' ';
  if(lc[cur]) preorder(lc[cur]);
  if(rc[cur]) preorder(rc[cur]);
}
// call preorder(1);
```

#### Inorder traversal
- The procedure of preorder traversal
  * Preorder Traverse left subtree
  * Visit current node
  * Preorder Traverse right subtree
- Traversal for binary search tree
- Implementation
```cpp
int lc[9] = {0, 2, 4, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0};
int rc[9] = {0, 3, 5, 7, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0};
void inorder(int cur) {
  if(lc[cur]) inorder(lc[cur]);
  cout << cur << ' ';
  if(rc[cur]) inorder(rc[cur]);
}
// call inorder(1);
```

#### Postorder traversal
- The procedure of preorder traversal
  * Preorder Traverse left subtree
  * Preorder Traverse right subtree
  * Visit current node
```cpp
int lc[9] = {0, 2, 4, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0};
int rc[9] = {0, 3, 5, 7, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0};
void postorder(int cur) {
  if(lc[cur]) postorder(lc[cur]);
  if(rc[cur]) postorder(rc[cur]);
  cout << cur << ' ';
}
// call postorder(1);
```
