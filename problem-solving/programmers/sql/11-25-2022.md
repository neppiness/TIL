# **SQL Query Problems**
### Problem #1. [5월 식품들의 총매출 조회하기](https://school.programmers.co.kr/learn/courses/30/lessons/131117)

#### Answer
```SQL
SELECT FR.PRODUCT_ID, PRODUCT_NAME, SUM(AMOUNT * PRICE) AS TOTAL_SALES
FROM FOOD_PRODUCT FR
JOIN FOOD_ORDER FO ON FR.PRODUCT_ID = FO.PRODUCT_ID
WHERE YEAR(PRODUCE_DATE) = 2022 AND MONTH(PRODUCE_DATE) = 5
GROUP BY PRODUCT_NAME
ORDER BY TOTAL_SALES DESC, PRODUCT_ID
;
```

- In this case, PRODUCT_ID is related to PRODUCT_NAME and data is distinguished by PRODUCT_NAME
  * Thus, proper PRODUCT_ID value is get from this query


### Problem #2. [주문량이 많은 아이스크림들 조회하기](https://school.programmers.co.kr/learn/courses/30/lessons/133027)

#### Answer
```SQL
SELECT FH.FLAVOR
FROM FIRST_HALF FH
JOIN JULY J ON FH.FLAVOR = J.FLAVOR
GROUP BY FLAVOR
ORDER BY SUM(J.TOTAL_ORDER + FH.TOTAL_ORDER) DESC
LIMIT 3
;
```


### Problem #3. [그룹별 조건에 맞는 식당 목록 출력하기](https://school.programmers.co.kr/learn/courses/30/lessons/131124)

#### 송문경's Answer
```SQL
SELECT mr.MEMBER_NAME, rr.REVIEW_TEXT,
    DATE_FORMAT(rr.REVIEW_DATE, '%Y-%m-%d') AS 'REVIEW_DATE'
FROM REST_REVIEW AS rr
LEFT JOIN MEMBER_PROFILE AS mr USING(MEMBER_ID)
WHERE rr.MEMBER_ID = (
    SELECT MEMBER_ID
    FROM REST_REVIEW
    GROUP BY MEMBER_ID
    ORDER BY COUNT(REVIEW_ID) DESC
    LIMIT 1
)
ORDER BY REVIEW_DATE, REVIEW_TEXT
;
```

- Note that `COUNT` clause could be used to `ORDER BY` clause
- Just join tables together and pick the one with the most reviews
- `USING` makes easy to `JOIN`

FROM APPOINTMENT
JOIN PATIENT USING(PT_NO)
JOIN DOCTOR ON DOCTOR.DR_ID = APPOINTMENT.MDDR_ID 
WHERE APNT_CNCL_YN = 'N' AND
    (YEAR(APNT_YMD) = 2022 AND
     MONTH(APNT_YMD) = 4 AND
     DAY(APNT_YMD) = 13)
ORDER BY APNT_YMD
```

    IF(OUT_DATE IS NULL, '출고미정',
       IF(OUT_DATE > '2022-05-01', '출고대기', '출고완료')
    ) AS '출고여부'
FROM FOOD_ORDER
ORDER BY ORDER_ID
```
- Date could be compared as `OUT_DATE > '2022-05-01'`
- IF could be used

FROM ANIMAL_INS
ORDER BY ANIMAL_ID
```

### Problem #8. [오랜 기간 보호한 동물(2)](https://school.programmers.co.kr/learn/courses/30/lessons/59411)

#### Answer
```SQL

JOIN ANIMAL_OUTS AO USING(ANIMAL_ID)
WHERE AO.DATETIME IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY AI.DATETIME - AO.DATETIME
LIMIT 2
;
```

### Problem #9. [카테고리 별 상품 개수 구하기](https://school.programmers.co.kr/learn/courses/30/lessons/131529)
