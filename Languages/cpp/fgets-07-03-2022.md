# **fgets()**
- [boj.kr/11718](../../Problem%20Solving/boj/File%20input%20and%20output/11718-07-03-2022.cpp)

### Description
The C library function char `*fgets(char *str, int n, FILE *stream)`:
- reads a line from the specified stream and stores it into the string pointed to by `str`

#### The function stops whichever comes first:
- (n-1) characters are read*;
- the newline character (`\n`) is read; or
- the end-of-file (`EOF`) is reached
  *Note: a string length of n consists of (n-1) characters and `\0`

<br>

### Declaration
```cpp
char *fgets(char *str, int n, FILE *stream)
```

<br>

### Parameters
- `str`: This is the pointer to an array of chars where the string read is stored
- `n`: This is the maximum number of characters to be read (including the final null-character). Usually, the length of the array passed as str is used.
- `stream`: This is the pointer to a FILE object that identifies the stream where characters are read from.

<br>

### Return Value
- On success, the function returns the same `str` parameter
- If the End-of-File (`EOF`) is encountered and no characters have been read, the contents of `str` remain unchanged and a null pointer is returned
- If an error occurs, a null pointer is returned

<br>

### Example
```cpp
fgets(str, 2, stdin);
```
- Input: `$ More than 2 Characters`
- Result: `M`
