# **JH's Today I Learned Repository**
Welcome to TIL of Jeong-hyun KimðŸ˜Š <br>
I've written TIL since May 14th, 2022

### Purposes of TIL
* List subjects to study today; motivate myself
* Note what I learned
* Wrap up a study for a day

### Why I write TIL in Github: advantages
* A commit for daily duty: rountinize studying
* Written in markdown: to get used to it
* Extendability and accessibility: obtained from 'Github' platform

### Markdown convention
* My own convention for markdown is given [here](/convention.md)
