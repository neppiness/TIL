# **Solution for boj.kr/14889**

### My solution
- Using next_permutation
- Not simple

### Point
- Search every difference value for a permutation
```cpp
  do {
    int diff = 0; // ability difference
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      for (int j = i+1; j < n; j++){
        if(team[i] != team[j]) continue;
        if(team[i] == 0) diff += (a[i][j] + a[j][i]);
        else diff -= (a[i][j] + a[j][i]);
      }
    }
    ans = min(ans, abs(diff));    
  } while (next_permutation(team.begin(), team.end()));
```

  vector<int> team(n);
  fill(team.begin() + n / 2, team.end(), 1);
  int ans = 0x7f7f7f7f;
  // team = {0, 0, 0, .., 0, 1, 1, .. ,1}, to classify team
  do {
    int diff = 0; // ability difference
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      for (int j = i+1; j < n; j++){
        if(team[i] != team[j]) continue;
        if(team[i] == 0) diff += (a[i][j] + a[j][i]);
        else diff -= (a[i][j] + a[j][i]);
      }
    }
    ans = min(ans, abs(diff));    
  } while (next_permutation(team.begin(), team.end()));
  cout << ans;
}
