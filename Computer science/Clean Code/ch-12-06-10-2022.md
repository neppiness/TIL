### I. Getting Clean via Emergent Design
Kent Beck's Four Rules of Software Design (also known as “Simple Design”)
- Passes the tests
- No duplication (DRY)
- Reveals intention: should be easy to understand
- Fewest elements (classes and methods): remove anything that doesn't serve the three previous rules


### II. Simple Design Rule 1: Runs All the Tests
- High level of coupling makes hard to write test cases
- The more test cases we make, the lower level of coupling should be achieve

### III. Simple Design Rules 2–4: Refactoring
- Refactoring using test cases

### IV. No Duplication
- Duplication makes additional works, more threats, and unnecessary complexity

### V. Expressive
- Use good name
- Make functions and classes smaller
- Use standard names
- Write an unit test case with caution
- Give effort

### VI. Minimal Classes and Methods
- The goal is to maintain small functions, classes and a system
- This rule has a lower priority than other rules
