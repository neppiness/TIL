# **SQL Query Problems**
### Problem #1. [12세 이하인 여자 환자 목록 출력하기](https://school.programmers.co.kr/learn/courses/30/lessons/132201)
#### Answer
```SQL
SELECT PT_NAME, PT_NO, GEND_CD, AGE, IFNULL(TLNO, 'NONE') AS TLNO
FROM PATIENT
WHERE GEND_CD = 'w' AND AGE <= 12
ORDER BY AGE DESC, PT_NAME ASC
```

- `IFNULL` could be used to fill the value instead of NULL
  * IFNULL(A, B) AS C
  * A: column to be checked whether the items are null or not
  * B: the specified value to be returned when the items are null
  * C: name of column to be set

FROM DOCTOR
WHERE MCDP_CD = 'CS' OR MCDP_CD = 'GS'
ORDER BY HIRE_YMD DESC, DR_NAME ASC
```

- `DATE_FORMAT`
  * '%Y-%m-%d': format to be set; `%M` expresses the month as full word, `%D` expresses the day as 1st, 2nd, 3rd, ..., etc and `%y` expresses the year in `YY` format.

- `LIKE pattern`: used in a WHERE clause to search for a specified pattern in a column.

- Syntax:
```SQL
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table_name
WHERE condition
GROUP BY column_name(s)
HAVING condition
ORDER BY column_name(s);
```
